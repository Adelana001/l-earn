# HoneySwap: The Decentralized Exchange In xDai Chain


HoneySwap is a decentralized exchange and Automatic Market Maker (AMM) for xDai Chain whose development, support and maintenance is carried out by the 1Hive community.
At HoneySwap you can trade any ERC20 token on the xDai blockchain with incredibly low commission spending.

## How HoneySwap works

The Dex HoneySwap is a fork of Uniswap v2 implemented in xDai Chain and every time someone makes an exchange, as in any web3 platform, you have to connect your wallet to access the exchange functions and build liquidity pools.

* First of all, you simply have to go to https://honeyswap.org/ connect 
a wallet that supports xDAI Chain, such as Metamask, alpha wallet, among others.

## Liquidity pools

From HoneySwap you can also provide liquidity to the various swap pairs.
Liquidity providers (LP) within the decentralized finance ecosystem are those people who contribute funds to a pool of cryptocurrencies to create a market.
In exchange for providing their funds, users get commissions for the operations carried out in their pool.
Liquidity providers earn a 0.25% Swap Fee on all trades in proportion to their share of the pool.
These fees are added to the pool, increasing your participation automatically, and you can claim them when you withdraw your liquidity.

To add liquidity, you must select the pair to which you want to add and it is important to know that it must be the same amount added in each token of said pair.

## Yield Farming

To provide liquidity to HoneySwap pools, 1Hive has created farming farms with very attractive returns that encourage the creation of liquidity pairs by users. In yield farming, users basically obtain profits by betting their generated tokens in the liquidity pool (LP)

                                          New RPC URL: https://rpc.xdaichain.com/
                                          String ID: 0x64 (100)
