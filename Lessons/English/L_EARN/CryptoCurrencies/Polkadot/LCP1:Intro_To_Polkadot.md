# POLKADOT NETWORK

Polkadot is a blockchain protocol and network that connects multiple blockchains, called **parachains**, into one primary blockchain, called the **relay chain**. Polkadot's native cryptocurrency is called DOT.

Parchains are specialized for specific purposes, and each handle their own parallel stream of transactions, while at the same time exchanging data with each other and the relay chain. The relay chain provides a layer of security for itself and all the parachains.

## Theory

Polkadot is known as a "sharded multichain network", where the parachains are the shards. Parralel processing power generated by the parachains leads to higher scalability than other single chain blockchains like Bitcoin.  Different parachains make different tradeoffs and might be optimized for different use cases, like Identity, supply chain, or file storage. Optimizing around a certain use cases means you can leave out unnecessary code to efficiency and security.

Polkadot lets developers build parachains using the **substrate framework**. Substrate is a framework for building blockchains

### Polkadot Components:

* Relay chain

* Parachains

* Parathreads

* Bridges

#### The relay chain

The relay chain is the heart of Polkadot, responsible for shared security, consensus and interoperability between chains on the network. Polkadot uses the Relay Chain primarily to 

* Validate transactions
* Nominate Validatators to validate transactions
* Preserve historical Data
* Monitor health of the entire Polkadot ecosystem.

users who stake DOT can validate transactions if they are nominated by the relay chian.

#### Parachains

A parachain is a complete blockchain that feeds to and from the Relay Chain. It is described by Polkadot in the whitepaper as "an application-specific data structure that is globally consistent and validatable."
Parachains are said to be on the same level as other blockchain networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Polkadot contain s multiple blockchains within itself. Hypothetically, you could include both the Bitcoin and Ethereum as parachains in the Polkadot network. 

#### Parathreads

Parathreads are temporary spaces in the Polkadot network, used primarily for testing ideas.
Parathreads are similar to Parachains in that they allow the construction of a blockchain or special use application.

#### Bridges

Bridges, or the ability of an individual blockchain to communicate and transfer value to another, have been absent in traditional blockchain technology.
Let's say you want to buy an NFT priced in ETH, but you only have BTC. Traditionally, you would have to convert BTC to fiat and then convert it to ETH, or buy ETH for BTC on an exchange. You simply cannot transfer value or data from one Blockchain to the other without an intermediate layer, be it an exchange or fiat.
Bridges change that restriction, and allow Parachains, which are essentially blockchains embedded within the Polkadot ecosystem, to communicate and share data.The economic sovereignty and diversity of the respective blockchains are not affected when communicating or transacting through the bridges.

### The polkadot currency (DOT)

In the Polkadot Network, DOT is for payments, transaction processing and governance. DOT is also used for PoS (Proof of Stake) relay chain validation. DOT is also used to compnesate validators, as a governance token, and as a general currency.

#### DOT Characteristics

DOT Holders have governance rights in the Polkadot Network. Holders can help determine network rates, vote on proposed network updates and allow parachains to be deployed or deleted. 

DOT is used to facilitate consensus on the network through staking. Staking By DOT helps to maintain the security of the network, stengthening Polkadot's consensus.

It has a binding function. This function is necessary for the addition of new parachains within the Polkadot network. When a bonding period is generated, the DOT tokens that have been attached are locked until the process ends

### Polkadot Consensus

Polkadot's consensus system called Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS). NPoS is similar to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism with slight variations.

With NPoS, the validators must offer infrastructure for the maintenance of the network. They have the task of producing the new blocks, the process of validating the parachain blocks and the security of the network. They must be available at all times and have the ability to run the infrastructure safely and reliably.

### Problems Polkadot Wants To Solve:

#### Scalability.


Most of the popular blockchains are not scalable due to their structure.
For example, long ago, it cost between a few cents and a few dollars equivalent to ETH to transact on Ethereum, the world's most popular blockchain. Today, Ethereum fees have cost more than $ 250

#### No or limited data communication and exchange.


Dozens of blockchains were created in isolation, and it is not possible for them to communicate or exchange value with each other. For example, you cannot send BTC on the ETH network.

#### Lack of customization.


Until the advent of Ethereum, blockchains did not support any customization of the transfer of value from one owner to another. Bitcoin, for example, only allowed peer-to-peer transactions. Smart Contracts allowed customizing and programming what can be achieved on a blockchain, to a limited extent.


#### Low energy impact validation mechanism.

A secure transaction validation mechanism is sought, at the same time that it does not require expensive hardware and high energy consumption

## Practice

### Set up a Polkadot Wallet

For this lesson, all you need to do is set up a Polkadot Wallet. There are many wallets available, include Atomic Wallet, IMToken, Enjin wallet, and Trust Wallet.

## Testing

After studying this lesson, let us know when you are ready to take the test.  The reward for passing is 0.2 DOT.
