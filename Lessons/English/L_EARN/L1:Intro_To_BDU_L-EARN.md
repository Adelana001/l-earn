Welcome to BDU L-EARN! We are a Learn and Earn community created by (Block Devs United)[https://bdu.dev], where you can learn about crypto, and earn crypto at the same time!

In BDU L-EARN, education is peer to peer, where students learn from and teach each other directly.

This lesson introduces you to BDU L-EARN, and teaches you how to get started. Read more below.

##Learn

Learning is our primary focus (learn first, earn second)! In this section you will learn what topics are on offer, how lessons are structured, and about learning paths in BDU L-EARN.

###Topics

The primary topic in this program is cryptocurrency. We cover the major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are adding more.

### Lesson Structure
Our educational material is organized in a tree like structure. The tree has learning categories, or "branches", and lessons, or "leafs". We call this the learning tree.

#### Lesson codes
Lessons are arranged by letter codes. The letter codes represent a branch on the learning tree

For example:
```
L: Learn and Earn
LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency
LCE: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency - Ethereum
LCEX: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency - Ethereum - xDaiChain
```
Each branch has it's lessons, or leafs.  For example, the branch LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency, has:
```
LC1: Intro_To_Cryptocurrency
LC2: Decentralized_Applications
LC3: Cold_Storage
```
and so on.

Every lesson has a place on the learning tree and is known by a lesson code. For example
```
LCEXD1 - dApps on xDaiChain
```
