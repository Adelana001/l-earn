### Lesson structure
Our educational material is organized in a tree like structure. The tree has learning categories, or "branches", and lessons, or "leafs". We call this the learning tree.

#### Lesson codes
Lessons are arranged by letter codes. The letter codes represent a branch on the learning tree

For example:
```
L: Learn and Earn
LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency
LCE: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency - Ethereum
LCEX: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency - Ethereum - xDaiChain
```
Each branch has it's lessons, or leafs.  For example, the branch LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency, has:
```
LC1: Intro_To_Cryptocurrency
LC2: Decentralized_Applications
LC3: Cold_Storage
```
and so on.

Every lesson has a place on the learning tree and is known by a lesson code. For example LCEXD1 - dApps on xDaiChain
