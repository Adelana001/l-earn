# Learn and Earn

This is a simple webapp-style landing page designed to provide information about the _"Learn and Earn"_ initiative. The page also redirects users to a [bounty platform](https://bdu.dev/) from which they can hunt Learn and Earn bounties or bounties from other initiatives (future feature).

Check it out [here](https://earn-2-learn.netlify.app/).

## The mission 

To help people earn cash by completing tutorials, and subsequently, spread knowledge about crypto-currencies, blockchain development, and web3 protocols.

## Usage

Run your own build of the Learn and Earn landing page. Feel free to make pull requests to improve on what's here. This landing page was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This initiatvie is currently in its pilot phase, onboarding a few people interested in testing out the platform. 

## How it works

Participants complete the lessons in this repo and reach out to admins via a Telegram chat group (link on the website) to get tested on what they've learnt. Upon successful validation that participants completed the lessons, they will receive a reward in xDai via simple hand-shake method.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`
To install the dependencies package.

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
