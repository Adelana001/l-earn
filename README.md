## Learn

Learning about cryptocurrency is our primary focus (learn first, earn second)! In this section you will learn what topics we focus on, how lessons are structured, and about learning paths in BDU L-EARN.

### Topics

Allmost all our lessons are focused on crypto. We offer small core of general crypto lessons for beginners, and an expanded set of lessons for blockchain developers. That's because BDU's core focus is to train blockchain developers

There is also a small group of lessons involving the BDU L-EARN program itself. This includes lessons on our community, on contributions, on the need for identity, and this very lesson itself!

### Learning Tree

Our educational material is organized in a tree like structure. The tree has learning categories, or "branches", and lessons, or "leafs". We call this the learning tree.

The primary topics are all about cryptocurrency. We cover the major cryptos Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are adding more as we go.

#### Lesson codes
Lessons are named by letter codes. The letter codes represent a branch on the learning tree

For example:
```
L: Learn and Earn
LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency
LCE: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency - Ethereum
LCEX: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency - Ethereum - xDaiChain
```
Each branch has it's lessons, or leafs.  For example, the branch LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency, has:
```
LC1: Intro_To_Cryptocurrency
LC2: Decentralized_Applications
LC3: Cold_Storage
```
and so on.

Every lesson has a place on the learning tree and is known by a lesson code. For example
```
LCEXD1 - dApps on xDaiChain
```

#### Learning Paths

A learning path is a list of lessons taken from the learning tree, that is geared towards  learning outcome. . Learning paths are basically courses w.

Anyone can create their own learning path from the learning tree, and share it with others.
