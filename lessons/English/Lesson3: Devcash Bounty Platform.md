### Devcash

Devcash is the native cryptocurrency for the BDU Ecosystem. We call Devcash "cash for the developer economy". Devcash is an ERC20 token on Ethereum, and bridged to xDAI. 

You can earn devcash by performing bounties on the bounty platform. You can also use devcash to incentivize others to work for you.

We are also running an IBO (Initial Bounty Offering)

### Bounty Hunting
"Bounty Hunting is a complicated profession" 
- The Client (Mandalorian Season 1 Ep 1)

A bounty is a task with a reward attached to it. The reward is normally given based on successful completion of task, not based time and effort expended.

Bounty hunting can be ruthless, but highly lucrative for those at the top of their game
