## Theory

### Bounty Hunting
"Bounty Hunting is a complicated profession" - The Client (Mandalorian Season 1 Ep 1)

A bounty is a task with a reward attached to it. The reward is normally given based on successful completion of task, not based time and effort expended.

There are multiple bounty platforms in the crypto space including Gitcoin, Bounties Network, Ox bounties, Rabbithole, BitcoinTalk bounties, and more. All these let you perform tasks in exchange for crypto. 

Bounty hunting can be ruthless, but highly lucrative for those at the top of their game. 

The most common form of bounty are bug bounties, however general bounties in the crypto space are becoming increasingly popular. 

### Platform Overview

The Devcash Bounty Platform was developed by BDU to incentivize developers to contribute to our organization. It works on both Ethereum mainnet (https://devcash.dev) and xDai chain (https://xdai.devcash.dev). We will be using the xDAI version.

Anybody can use the platform to post or hunt for bounties. ETH, xDAI and Devcash are currently supported as rewards.

### Devcash Background

Devcash is the native cryptocurrency for the BDU Ecosystem. We call Devcash "cash for the developer economy". Devcash is an ERC20 token on Ethereum, and bridged to xDAI. 

You can earn Devcash by performing bounties on the bounty platform, and contributing to the BDU ecosystem.  You can use Devcash to incentivize others to work for you by posting bounties. 

We are currently running an IBO (Initial Bounty Offering).
