## 1. Theory
### What is Ethereum
Ethereum is open source software running on a decentralized network of computers. Ethereum maintains consensus across all the computers in it's network with Proof of Work (PoW). In the near future Ethereum will be moving to a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism.

### Ethereum Basics
#### What is Ether
Ethereum has a native currency called "Ether", or "Eth".

#### What are Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are small computer programs called smart contracts are replicated and processed on all the computers on the Ethereum network, without a central coordinator. Smart Contracts allow you to program contracts that can be automatically enforced by computer code.  

#### What are ERC20 Tokens
In addition to Ether, people can also create and use their own currencies on Ethereum. The most common form of currency is ERC20 tokens. ERC20 Tokens are smart contracts that fit the ERC20 standard. The ERC20 standard was created so that everyone could follow it and create tokens that behave the same way.

## 2. Practice

### Using Metamask 
- Go to [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)

- Follow the instructions and install the Metamask browser extension.

- When get your new seed phrase, (the the 12 words phrase), write it down somewhere safe. This is your wallet backup.

## 3. Testing

For this pilot phase of Learn and Earn, you'll have someone from BDU test your knowledge on a 1-to-1 call, using [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) to verify your identity. Get intouch with them via this repo or on the Telegram group on our website. 

### Share your Ethereum address
Once Metamask is installed, copy your address and send it to one of the owners of this repo.
